MissingOutputException in rule extract_data in file /home/bec51319.iitr/workplace/tcga_data_analysis/expression_data.smk, line 10:
Job 3  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/tcga_data
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
